Need help? Want to help this project? See below!

## Reporting an Issue

Before you begin, please [search open and past issues][open-issues] to see if
your issue or feature request is already being talked about.

If you find your issue already exists, make sure to [bump the issue by adding a
reaction][github-blog]. **If you're serious about wanting an issue to get
attention, use a reaction in place of a "+1" or other similar comment.**

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, then
you're clear to create your issue using the guidelines below.

### Standard Reactions

Analysis of issue popularity (by tooling or otherwise) relies on the following
reaction emojis being present on issues, PRs, and replies:

`:+1:` 👍🏿👍🏾👍🏽👍🏼👍🏻👍 — up vote (AKA: _approve_, _like_, _+1_)

`:-1:` 👎🏿👎🏾👎🏽👎🏼👎🏻👎 — down vote (AKA: _disapprove_, _dislike_, _-1_)

### Bug Reports and Feature Requests

For the timeliest resolution to bug reports specifically, please make a good
faith effort to [follow the template][choose-new-issue]. The more quality
information you can provide, the quicker a fix will be found. Additionally:

- Ensure you file one issue per problem or feature request.
- Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
- Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless you're
  experiencing identical behavior or behavior that stems from the exact same
  problem.

That's it! You are now ready to [submit a new issue][choose-new-issue]! Thank
you for contribution 🎉, your efforts are greatly appreciated! 🙌🏿

#### Closure Policy

- Issues that do not follow the appropriate template or contain necessary
  information may be closed immediately and the poster directed to these
  guidelines.
- Issues that go for an extended period without activity are subject to closure.
